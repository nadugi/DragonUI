## 📅 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Dark Mode** - Darkens all UI borders and frame chrome (action bars, unit frames, minimap, bags, micro menu, castbar, stance/pet bars, XP/Rep bars). Three intensity presets (Light, Medium, Dark) plus a custom color picker for full control

- **Enhanced Tooltips** - Class-colored tooltip borders, class-colored unit names, target-of-target line, styled health bar, and optional anchor-to-cursor mode.

- Compact raid frame compatibility polling no longer runs constantly out of combat, reducing CPU usage
- Removed leftover debug messages that were cluttering the chat on login
- XP and reputation bars are now managed as separate, independently movable frames in Editor Mode instead of sharing a single combined frame
